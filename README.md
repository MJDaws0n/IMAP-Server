# IMAP-Server
A very poorly coded imap server

Does actual work (with gmail mobile client).

I reversed engineered gmail's imap client to build it, as I for whatever reason never chose to actually just google how imap works.

I made this a while ago, just decided to upload code now, so don't judge.

Reads from some databade.

I accidently left the databse credentials in the file because i'm so smart. I have changed the password though thankfully. No hacking me plz. That domain is also out of use so don't try getting in there.

I cannot remmember but a fair amount is likley made using GPT 3
